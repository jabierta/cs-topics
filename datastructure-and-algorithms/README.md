What I want is to use this to create and demonstrate in a UI preferably an phone app.
Something that lets you manipulate data structures similar to this: https://algorithm-visualizer.org/
But adds the addtional feature that enables you to play around the objects themselves
Games like guessing what the end structure would be based on an algorithm
for example how would a bubble sort this array step by step?

It would be good to insert Time complexity of each operations.
